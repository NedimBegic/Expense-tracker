# Expense-tracker
This is my first site using React. The main purpose of making it is to learn the basics of React and JSX. <br>
<h3>What I learned:</h3> 
<ul>
  <li>component building,</li>
  <li>state lifting up (communicating child to parent and child to child),</li>
  <li>passing data using props,</li>
  <li>useState hook,</li>
  <li>writing JSX and writing Javascript inside the render(),</li>
  <li>-splitting components into multiple components,</li>
  <li>-organizing component files,</li>
  <li>-controlled vs uncontrolled components,</li>
</ul>
